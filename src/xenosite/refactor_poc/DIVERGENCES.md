# Divergences

Canonical-SMILES disagreements between this proof of concept and the old
library. A listing is the record. It is not permission to drop a real
metabolite the old code emits, and it is not permission to hide a product
only the new code emits. Sites may differ when `topol_equiv` puts them in
the same atom class. Order does not matter.

## Hydroxylation of butylbenzene

The old second pattern writes a carbonyl. Both patterns add OH and remove
one H. The `>>[*:1]=O` products are not metabolites.

- Reactant: `c1ccc(CCCC)cc1`
- Only old: `CC(=O)CCc1ccccc1`, `CCC(=O)Cc1ccccc1`, `CCCC(=O)c1ccccc1`
- Only new: none
- Shared: `CC(O)CCc1ccccc1`, `CCC(O)Cc1ccccc1`, `CCCC(O)c1ccccc1`, `CCCCc1ccc(O)cc1`, `CCCCc1cccc(O)c1`, `CCCCc1ccccc1O`, `OCCCCc1ccccc1`

Ethane (`CC`) does not hit that carbonyl. Both libraries yield `CCO` only.
